# Smart-Home-IOT-System

Smart home project was a project based on **CC2530 stack and Zigbee protocol**. 
It was actually an IOT project. It used some sensors, like lighting, temperature, humidity , smoke and accelerator to monitor environmental parameters. 
They were all wirelessly connected with a master node which were connected to the server computer. The sensors collected environmental parameters and converted to a string of data and sent them to the master node. 
Then the master node received the data and sent to the computer. There was a platform in the computer used to analyze the data and convert them to the friendly numbers. And the whole system could be executed automatically. We could set an upper bound for different parameters and when that particular index reached the limit, the computer could ask the master node to send  a string of data to control some machines. In summary, this project simulated real-life smart home scenario and it could bring convenience to people.
